Fire, Explosions, and so, so much more!


Mar. 22, '21 - Black Powder!
	This morning, SWIM went to Lowe's and picked up the last of the supplies SWIM needed for black powder!
	Spectracide Stump Remover for $6 / lb of KNO3.
	Ridge Charcoal for $8 / 16 lb (Carbon source)
	And a few days ago, SWIM picked up dusting sulfur, like for your lawn, from ACE hardware.
	
	My first recipe:
	100 grams total.
	75% KNO3, 'straight from can'
	15% Charcoal, crushed in-between plastic bag inside paper bag, then blended to a powder
	10% Sulfur, 'straight from can'
	
	Results:
	It worked! Burns rather quickly (~1-2sec).
	Ignition isn't the easiest with a soft flame, but a 'jet' or 'torch' flame works great.
	It melts through aluminium foil if you try to test it on that, so SWIM think it's working rather well :).
	SWIM want to try some different compositions now.
	
	Batch 1:
	Black Powder, my first recipe
	10 grams total.
	75% KNO3
	15% Charcoal
	10% Sulfur
	
	Batch 2:
	Blasting Powder, used for mining rock
	10 grams total
	70% KNO3
	15% Charcoal
	10% Sulfur
	
	Batch 3:
	British Gun Powder Mk. VII
	65% KNO3
	20% Charcoal
	15% Sulfur
	
	
	Batch 4:
	Sulfur-free Mealed Powder (SMP)
	10 grams total
	70.5% KNO3
	29.5% Charcoal
	
	RESULTS:
	Batch 1: Sparks, bright flame, quick burn, long ignition.
	Batch 2: Faster ignition, less sparks, much brighter, longer burn.
	Batch 3: Even faster ignition, sparks like B1 but bright like B2.
	Batch 4: SPARKS! Long ignition, slow burn, lots of spewing & spitting.
	
	British Gun Powder Mk. VII is what SWIM uses as an ignition source, while Gunpowder/SMP is what SWIM uses for main fuel, for looks.
	
	By ripping ~100mm wide sections of paper towel, and measuring out 1.25g of Gunpowder, as well as 0.25g of BGP Mk. VII, you can make an improvized firework.
	Start by dumping the main fuel across the towel, so that it can be rolled up later. On one end, put the BGP Mk. VII, and remember to ignite from that end.
	Roll up tightly.
	Light and enjoy!
	
	

Mar. 23, '21 - Nitrocellulose!

	The night before, SWIM prepared a solution of Sulfuric Acid and Potassium Nitrate.
	
		35g KNO3
		50mL H2SO4
	
	It froze immediately upon adding, and was impossible to stir or remove from the glass, so SWIM let it sit overnight, inside where it was warm.
	SWIM believes the freezing problem was due to being outside in 0 ÂºC weather.
	In the morning, the 'ice' remained, so SWIM started stirring, and it incorporated after 5-10 minutes of stirring (my poor arms).
	After that, SWIM was left with a yellow-brown, viscous goop that SWIM had to somehow soak cotton in.
	To be exact, 4g of cotton.
	SWIM went outside, where it was cold, and let everything cool down. While SWIM was doing that, SWIM weighed out the 4g of cotton SWIM needed, from cotton make-up removal pads.
	With everything ready, SWIM added the cotton into the solution, and started 'mixing'.
	It seemed more like folding at this point.
	After 5 minutes of stirring, SWIM gathered it all in a pile using my stir rod (a pipette), and left it to soak.
	SWIM checked on it after ~15 minutes, and the cotton on the outside had dried out and was white again in some spots.
	So, SWIM stirred it again. After a thorough mixing, SWIM left it in a blob to soak again.
	When SWIM came back, this time after 45 minutes, the blob had turned to a puddle.
	Any remnants of cotton that were stuck together was now evenly distributed within the goop.
	SWIM prepared a solution of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, NaHCO3), and set it beside the container with the solution and cotton in it.
	SWIM slowly scooped over all the cotton SWIM could from the solution, making sure to go slowly to prevent a foam-over.
	After adding it all, and the foaming had died down, SWIM brought the (now non-toxic) cotton-baking soda solution inside.
	SWIM used a coffee filter in a funnel to act as a washing setup. Slowly, SWIM washed all the cotton with water.
	The draining takes FOREVER!
