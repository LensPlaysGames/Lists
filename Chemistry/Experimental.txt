Fire, Explosions, and so, so much more!


Mar. 22, '21 - Black Powder!
	This morning, SWIM went to Lowe's and picked up the last of the supplies SWIM needed for black powder!
	Spectracide Stump Remover for $6 / lb of KNO3.
	Ridge Charcoal for $8 / 16 lb (Carbon source)
	And a few days ago, SWIM picked up dusting sulfur, like for your lawn, from ACE hardware.
	
	My first recipe:
	100 grams total.
	75% KNO3, 'straight from can'
	15% Charcoal, crushed in-between plastic bag inside paper bag, then blended to a powder
	10% Sulfur, 'straight from can'
	
	Results:
	It worked! Burns rather quickly (~1-2sec).
	Ignition isn't the easiest with a soft flame, but a 'jet' or 'torch' flame works great.
	It melts through aluminium foil if you try to test it on that, so SWIM think it's working rather well :).
	SWIM want to try some different compositions now.
	
	Batch 1:
	Black Powder, my first recipe
	10 grams total.
	75% KNO3
	15% Charcoal
	10% Sulfur
	
	Batch 2:
	Blasting Powder, used for mining rock
	10 grams total
	70% KNO3
	15% Charcoal
	10% Sulfur
	
	Batch 3:
	British Gun Powder Mk. VII
	65% KNO3
	20% Charcoal
	15% Sulfur
	
	
	Batch 4:
	Sulfur-free Mealed Powder (SMP)
	10 grams total
	70.5% KNO3
	29.5% Charcoal
	
	RESULTS:
	Batch 1: Sparks, bright flame, quick burn, long ignition.
	Batch 2: Faster ignition, less sparks, much brighter, longer burn.
	Batch 3: Even faster ignition, sparks like B1 but bright like B2.
	Batch 4: SPARKS! Long ignition, slow burn, lots of spewing & spitting.
	
	British Gun Powder Mk. VII is what SWIM uses as an ignition source, while Gunpowder/SMP is what SWIM uses for main fuel, for looks.
	
	By ripping ~100mm wide sections of paper towel, and measuring out 1.25g of Gunpowder, as well as 0.25g of BGP Mk. VII, you can make an improvized firework.
	Start by dumping the main fuel across the towel, so that it can be rolled up later. On one end, put the BGP Mk. VII, and remember to ignite from that end.
	Roll up tightly.
	Light and enjoy!
	

Mar. 23, '21 - Nitrocellulose!

	The night before, SWIM prepared a solution of Sulfuric Acid and Potassium Nitrate outside in the ~0 ºC weather.
	
		35g KNO3
		50mL H2SO4
	
	It froze immediately upon adding, and was impossible to stir or remove from the glass, so SWIM let it sit overnight, inside where it was warm.
	SWIM believes the freezing problem was due to being outside in 0 ºC weather.
	In the morning, the 'ice' remained, so SWIM started stirring, and it incorporated after 5-10 minutes of stirring (my poor arms).
	
	After that, SWIM was left with a yellow-brown, viscous goop that SWIM had to somehow soak cotton in.
	To be exact, 4g of cotton.
	SWIM went outside, where it was cold, and let everything cool down. While SWIM was doing that, SWIM weighed out the 4g of cotton SWIM needed, from cotton make-up removal pads.
	With everything ready, SWIM added the cotton into the solution, and started 'mixing'.
	It seemed more like folding at this point.
	After 5 minutes of stirring, SWIM gathered it all in a pile using my stir rod (a pipette), and left it to soak.
	SWIM checked on it after ~15 minutes, and the cotton on the outside had dried out and was white again in some spots.
	So, SWIM stirred it again. After a thorough mixing, SWIM left it in a blob to soak again.
	When SWIM came back, this time after 45 minutes, the blob had turned to a puddle.
	Any remnants of cotton that were stuck together was now evenly distributed within the goop.
	
	SWIM prepared a solution of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, NaHCO3), and set it beside the container with the solution and cotton in it.
	SWIM slowly scooped over all the cotton SWIM could from the solution, making sure to go slowly to prevent a foam-over.
	After adding it all, and the foaming had died down, SWIM brought the (now non-toxic) cotton-baking soda solution inside.
	SWIM used a coffee filter in a small, red, automotive funnel to act as a washing setup. Slowly, SWIM washed all the cotton with water.
	The draining takes FOREVER! Vacuum filtering would be a giant plus, maybe even just a buchner funnel in general.
	
	After washing it 5-10 times, over the course of the whole day, SWIM can safely say it is rinsed now.
	SWIM is going to leave it in the automotive funnel to dry overnight, then pick it out in the morning.
	SWIM is worried that if SWIM tries to remove the filter now, the wet paper will just rip immediately.
	
	Hopefully, by mid-day tomorrow, SWIM will be left with dry, white nitrocellulose!
	Testing will commence, but SWIM will update this entry before doing so as to the state of the dryness of the material in the morning.
	
	It is the morning of the 24th of March, 2021. 
	
		The nitrocellulose has all coalesced, SWIM guesses you could say, into one big conglomerate.
		It was still quite wet. SWIM decided it was time to remove it from the funnel, and into the open air-stream of the evaporation station.
		SWIM decided to pull the filter out, and lay it on the wire shelf for drying from beneath and above.
		It was quite easy to remove, and the cotton being all in one big piece is very helpful, as opposed to the tiny bits and balls that it was before.
		SWIM used a paper towel to squeeze out some water, just by pressing on it from the top.
		SWIM spread it as thin as it could go while still being well within the boundaries of the filter paper, and left to dry completely.
		
		It is 1300 hours, and there is a yellow color developing. It was much whiter when wet, and is slowly getting more 'crisp' as it yellows.
		SWIM read online that truly dry nitrocellulose is white, and that the yellow goes away as it dries completely, but SWIM would be surprised if this was the case.
		SWIM tested a few dry, crispy pieces about 3-5mm in diameter, and they have not burnt at all. 
		Hopefully, this is due to it still being slightly wet, and not because of impurity or incomplete reaction, or not enough washing, something. :\
		
		Yeah, SWIM may have screwed something up somewhere along the line... They are all crispy dry, but dark, dark brown. Maybe SWIM didn't wash the acid out well enough?
		SWIM is not sure. Or it's leeching from the coffee-filter somehow. SWIM doesn't know. SWIM is sad.
		
	
	NEXT TIME: 
		
		Don't cool the H2SO4 and KNO3 while dissolving, only while adding the cotton, otherwise the Potassium Carbonate and Potassium Sulfate formed can't dissolve and it ends up crashing out, and freezing the solution.
		&
		Make more!
		&
		Don't let it sit in the funnel, just take the wet filter out. It doesn't do much drying in there.
		A hair dryer can help speed things up, but not towards the end as the cotton becomes light enough that it can blow away.
		&
		Use a different recipe, more liquid so it's easier to mix and stuff (2 cups H2SO4 + 1 cup KNO3 + 10g cotton, from schel sullivan on YT).
		
	

Mar. 25, '21 - Manganese Heptoxide!
	
	Mn2O7, manganese heptoxide, can be formed by adding KMnO4, potassium permanganate, into an excess of H2SO4, sulfuric acid.
	A green oil can be seen forming over the period of 15-60 seconds; this is the manganese heptoxide.
	Having a whopping seven oxygen molecules, Mn2O7 is a powerful oxidizer.
	Because of the strength of this oxidation, the reaction can be quite vigorous.
	Almost any organic material can be oxidized by manganese heptoxide.
	Organic solvents, like ethanol, often detonate upon addition.
	Organic materials, like cellulose, ignite upon contact.
	Plastics will be oxidized, but SWIM has not tested this, as it will generate many nasty fumes.
	That being said, plastic reaction vessels will not work for this reaction. Glass only.
	A jar upside-down works great, as well as keep the volume synthesized small, which is always good.
	Any larger amount than 1.5g of KMnO4 added to an excess of H2SO4 is highly not recommended for safety reasons.
	
	FUELS TESTED:
	
	Cotton Ball: Ignites upon contact, pops for a few seconds, then burns the cotton to ash.
	
	Denatured Alcohol (Ethanol + Propan-2-ol): One drop pops and snaps upon contact and sends unreacted alcohol flying. A mL detonates with a large fireball, popping and crackling for 15-120 seconds afterwards.
	
	SWIM wants to try more fuels: Charcoal Powder, Gunpowder, Printer Paper, PLA Plastic, Paper Towel, Fruit Peel, Cotton Swab (Q-Tip), etc.
	

Mar. 26, '21 - Nitrocellulose, but less idiot.

	Nitrocellulose is relatively easy to make, when you aren't a blubbering fool with no brain.
	SWIM must have been born yesterday with the amount of stupidity carried out through that first nitrocellulose attempt.
	
	So, let's go through a few things SWIM now knows:
		- Don't use a funnel and filter to wash something that isn't a fine particulate or toxic, just wash it with your hands!
		- Don't use a make-up product and expect purity of any kind!
		- Don't make a tiny amount of something that is cheap but takes a lot of work! Just do it in bulk, and if it doesn't work, it's cheap, that's okay, try again.
		
	Now, let SWIM tell you about today:
	
		A nitration solution made up of KNO3 and H2SO4 was prepared the night before.
		1 cup of KNO3 to 2 cups of H2SO4.
		Chunks of KNO3 remained, but I decided to push forward anyways.
		The recipe called for 21 cotton balls, so 20 were used, hoping that they are a similar size.
		After plopping and pushing in the 20 cotton balls, 15 minutes are let pass by. At this point, the mixture is stirred again.
		After a thorough stirring, the mixture was left to nitrate. This can be anywhere from 1 hour to 6 hours.
		SWIM decided to give it a thorough go-around, and let it nitrate for a good 4-5 hours.
		A large container of water was prepared, as well as a large container with baking soda in the bottom, and some water.
		The cotton balls were transferred from the nitration mixture to the water. After two to three were in the water, I would stir until all color was homogeneous.
		After stirring, the slightly-rinsed cotton was transferred to the baking soda container to neutralize.
		Expect foaming, lots of it.
		After enough cotton had built up in the neutralization solution, it was transferred to another container with baking soda in the bottom.
		After what felt like an eternity, all of the cotton was neutralized and in one container.
		The cotton was then taken to a sink, and rinsed by filling the container and mixing for some time.
		To collect the cotton, SWIM used my fingers like a fish-net to gather as much cotton as possible, and ring it out by squeezing it into a ball in my fist.
		The cotton should be rinsed and rang many times, at least five. If not, the cotton can have baking soda left in it, and baking soda extinguishes fire, making this whole process pretty useless :).
		The good news is you can always rinse it, even if you forgot and dried it first.
		At this point, the cotton was a light-yellow color, and the water was clear coming off of it.
		SWIM started to get excited, as the texture resembled cotton, and not a plastic soup like the last batch.
		The cotton was left to dry (dried with paper towel, pressed into pieces, set in front of fan).
		After about one hour, the cotton has whitened, and feels very dry.
		A small burn test still shows that it is wet, so it will be left dry for a few more hours, then do a proper test, and weigh my yield!
		I ended up waiting overnight.
		
	

	Mar. 27, '21 - Nitrocellulose, but it works!
	
		It is the next morning. 
		An imprecise scale showed 15g of nitrocellulose as my final, dry yield. I will have to weigh my cotton balls to figure out rough yield %.
		
		Burn test concludes that this is properly nitrated cellulose! 
		Not as fast as 'professional' nitrocellulose/flash paper/flash cotton, but it is so much faster than regular cotton.
		It also leaves minimal residue/ash, and burns before it hits the ground, even in modest amounts.
		Definitely enough for a magician, or a layman like SWIM that just likes explosions and fire :).
		To further nitrate the material, it can just be 'double-dipped' and ran through the whole process again, treating it as starting material.
		
		(Nitrocellulose will be referred to as NC through-out the following text.)
		
		Aluminium Foil makes a great 'pop' when rolled around a cylindrical object (like a pen), filled with ~0.25g NC, the ends pinched and folded closed, and then heated with a BBQ lighter.
		Anything more than 1g would be kind of risky, and would require extremely serious safety precautions.
		
		SWIM feels rather uneasy about storing over 10g of the stuff.
		It is within a plastic container, with the lid closed. 
		Ideally, it would be in glass, but SWIM does not own anything large enough to store the NC safely.
		The reason for this being that plastic can hold a charge much more easily than glass can, and it could potentially (but very unlikely) make a spark.
		SWIM has read that NC can be stored more safely if wet with alcohol, but it seems like this would make it easier to ignite due to the vapors, at least in this case.
		
		
		Some Facts:
		
		- Nitrocellulose with less than 12% nitrogen concentration is not deemed an explosive (and therefore not illegal, technically), and is soluble in a mixture of acetone/ether.
		This soluble nitrocellulose is sometimes referred to as 'collodion'.
		
		- Nitrocellulose with more than 13% nitrogen (sometimes called insoluble nitrocellulose) can be prepared by prolonged exposure to hot, concentrated acids.
		This method was used to make naval mines, warheads, torpedoes, and blasting explosives for mining.
		After production of 'guncotton' started in the 1860s by Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills, the material rapidly became popular, and dominated the explosives industry.
		This W.A.R.G.M. guncotton was the main source for military warheads at the time.
		
		- In 1832, Henri Braconnot discovered that nitric acid and wood fibers created a lightweight combustible explosive. He named this 'xyloïdine'.
		
			In 1846 (thereabouts), German-Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein spilled a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid on the kitchen table.
		He reached for the nearest towel/cloth to clean up the mess, and grabbed a cotton apron just by chance.
		After soaking up the mixture, he hung the apron on the kitchen stove door to dry.
		As soon as it was dry, a flash occured as the apron ignited. 
		Christian Friedrich Schönbein went on to develop a method to make this flammable material: immerse one part fine cotton in 15 parts equal mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. The cotton was then dried slowly at 40 ºC.
		This method was widely used upon publishing.
		However, Christian Friedrich Schönbein did not work alone on this paper.
		Rudolf Christian Böttger independantly discovered a similar process, so they worked together to figure out the best method, then published it.
		
			Coincidentally, another chemist, F. J. Otto had produced 'guncotton' in 1846 and was the first to publish the process, which was largely similar to Schönbein and Böttger's method.
		This largely upset the German Chemists.
		
			With this new 'guncotton' invention patented, of course companies were itching to get their hands on it.
		One company, John Hall & Son, bought the rights to the patent of F. J. Otto's 'guncotton', and immediately started industrial manufacturing.
		Due to the manufacturing process not being fully understood, adequate safety measured were not put in place.
		The cotton, after nitration, was not properly washed. When nitrocellulose from the nitration mixture goes unwashed, or is not washed properly, some dilute acids will linger inside the nitrocellulose.
		Once dry, the evaporated water concentrates the trace amounts of acid. This can further nitrate any cellulose that went unreacted.
		Over time, the nitrogen content keeps rising, and rising, and rising. As this happens, the chemical becomes more unstable, and more likely to spontaneously combust, even at room temperature.
		Because of this, unwashed nitrocellulose is often referred to as 'pyrocellulose'.
		
		Unfortunately for the hard-working employees of John Hall & Son, less than a year into production, in July of 1846, that is exactly what happened, killing almost two dozen workers.
		Twenty lives were lost because someone forgot to wash... 
		Needless to say, the factory was immediately closed.
		Guncotton manufacturing was shut down prety much globally, at least until a safer method came around.
		
			This is where the British chemist Frederick Augustus Abel developed a safe method for guncotton manufacture.
		The method proposed by Fred extended the washing and drying of the nitrocellulose to 48 hours, as well as repeated eight times over to ensure leftover acids were washed out.
		The nitration mixture was changed from equal parts sulfuric acid and nitric acid to two parts sulfuric acid, one part nitric acid (1 H2SO4:1 HNO3 -> 2 H2SO4:1 HNO3).
		Nitration can be controlled by adjusting acid concentrations, as well as reaction temperature.
		
	

		NEXT TIME:
		
		- RECIPE RATIOS: "schel sullivan" on YT has the best recipe, which is similar to Frederick Augustus Abel's recipe, who patented the method in 1865.
			( 2 cups H2SO4 : 1 cup KNO3 : ~20g cotton )
		
		- RECIPE INGREDIENTS: 
			Testing other cotton sources would be very interesting, like cotton paper, cotton clothing, cotton yarn, and coffee filters.
		
		- RECIPE INGREDIENTS: 
			As well as other cotton sources, testing different cellulose sources other than cotton would also be very interesting, like tissue paper, toilet paper, printer paper, paper towels, and cardboard.
			Some sort of testing method will have to be developed! 
			Maybe DSLR video + Shitty-Phone-Slo-Mo would gather enough data on each one. 
			Test equivalent weights, volumes, etc, and qualitatively compare, maybe.
			
		- SAFETY:
			When storing large amounts of Nitrocellulose (which looks deceivingly small), it is safest to store wet under alcohol, ideally.
			
		
	






STUFF TO DO:

 - DIY FUSE
	Methods:
	- Slow Burning Fuse - (ALSO FEATURED IN 'Making Sparklers', RELEASED ONE YEAR LATER)
	[BY] TKOR - Grant Thompson
	[INGREDIENTS] 4m COTTON YARN | 36g KNO3 | 24g GRANULATED WHITE TABLE SUGAR | 60mL water | OPTIONAL: FOOD COLORING
	[PROCEDURE] Prepare a mixture consisting of 36g of KNO3, and 24g of granulated white table sugar. Preheat a frying pan to medium heat. Add 1/3 cup water. 
		Once boiling, sprinkle in the full 60g mixture. Stir until fully dissolved, evident by a clear solution.
		Boil until very frothy/foamy. Add cotton yarn, holding onto one end to prevent knotting.
		Continue heating to drive off most of the remaining water, trying to make sure the solution soaks evenly into the yarn.
		Once the yarn has soaked up most, if not all, of the solution, spread on an oven baking sheet in a pattern reminiscing a sine-wave, like how long lines go back and forth, or zig-zagging, crocodiling, etc.
		This is to ensure long, straight pieces of fuse, as it will be rigid after this next step.
		The baking sheet goes into an oven set to 150 ºC (300 ºF) for 20 minutes.
		Haflway through baking, remember to nudge it slightly to prevent sticking to the pan when cooling.
		After the time is up, it is taken out and left to cool. A golden-yellow color is expected.
		When cool, it will be fully stiff. Cut at bends for pieces of long, straight, and rigid fuse to store.
		KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT, SPARK, FLAME, AND MOST OF ALL: DON'T BE STUPID! (this parts from SWIM).
		
	- Black Powder Fuse
	[BY] TKOR - Grant Thompson
	[INGREDIENTS] STRIPS OF TISSUE PAPER, FINE BLACK POWDER
	[PROCEDURE] Prepare a strip of tissue paper, wetting down to keep from blowing away, and easier to work with.
		Add black powder length-wise, from end to end, leaving a little bit of room to fold/roll/twist it closed.
		Start rolling fuse by taking one corner of tissue paper, and rolling at a 45º angle, as tightly as possible.
		Continue this for the entire length of tissue paper.
		Once rolled up, let dry overnight, and the fuses are ready to be used (although, in a pinch, they also burn right away with good enough black powder).
		
	

 - DIY CANNON
	
	A little cannon sounds like a lot of fun. As long as it doesn't employ the use of more than 1/4 oz (7 grams) of explosives, it is not a 'destructive device' and is not federally illegal in the United States.
	However, other laws are often the problem, as in 'endangering others' or 'disrupting the peace'. Any loud bangs or flying projectiles are a large attention grabber by LE.
	The idea is to make it small enough as to not have a LOUD bang, but still big enough to have a fun one :).
	
	[PROJECTILE]
	1/4" steel ball bearings as ammo.
	
	[IGNITION]
	Slow Burning Fuse (detailed above) for the fuse that goes into a drilled hole in the side of the steel pipe.
	
	[FUEL]
	Gunpowder as a fuel? Or maybe nitrocellulose. Either way, it will be fun :).
	
	[COMBUSTION CHAMBER]
	1/8" steel pipe nipple as the 'barrel'. 
	1/8" Schedule 40 Steel Pipe has an ID of 0.269", which should be just big enough to fit a 1/4" steel ball bearing.
	Why is a 1/8" pipe actually 1/4"? IDFK.
	Also, a 1/8" steel end cap for one side of the nipple pipe (pipe nipple?).
