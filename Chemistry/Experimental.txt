Fire, Explosions, and so, so much more!


Mar. 22, '21 - Black Powder!
	This morning, I went to Lowe's and picked up the last of the supplies I needed for black powder!
	Spectracide Stump Remover for $6 / lb of KNO3.
	Ridge Charcoal for $8 / 16 lb (Carbon source)
	And a few days ago, I picked up dusting sulfur, like for your lawn, from ACE hardware.
	
	My first recipe:
	100 grams total.
	75% KNO3, 'straight from can'
	15% Charcoal, crushed in-between plastic bag inside paper bag, then blended to a powder
	10% Sulfur, 'straight from can'
	
	Results:
	It worked! Burns rather quickly (~1-2sec).
	Ignition isn't the easiest with a soft flame, but a 'jet' or 'torch' flame works great.
	It melts through aluminium foil if you try to test it on that, so I think it's working rather well :).
	I want to try some different compositions now.
	
	Batch 1:
	Black Powder, my first recipe
	10 grams total.
	75% KNO3
	15% Charcoal
	10% Sulfur
	
	Batch 2:
	Blasting Powder, used for mining rock
	10 grams total
	70% KNO3
	15% Charcoal
	10% Sulfur
	
	Batch 3:
	British Gun Powder Mk. VII
	65% KNO3
	20% Charcoal
	15% Sulfur
	
	
	Batch 4:
	Sulfur-free Mealed Powder (SMP)
	10 grams total
	70.5% KNO3
	29.5% Charcoal
	
	RESULTS:
	Batch 1: Sparks, bright flame, quick burn, long ignition.
	Batch 2: Faster ignition, less sparks, much brighter, longer burn.
	Batch 3: Even faster ignition, sparks like B1 but bright like B2.
	Batch 4: SPARKS! Long ignition, slow burn, lots of spewing & spitting.
	
	British Gun Powder Mk. VII is what I use as an ignition source, while Gunpowder/SMP is what I use for main fuel, for looks.
	
	By ripping ~100mm wide sections of paper towel, and measuring out 1.25g of Gunpowder, as well as 0.25g of BGP Mk. VII, you can make an improvized firework.
	Start by dumping the main fuel across the towel, so that it can be rolled up later. On one end, put the BGP Mk. VII, and remember to ignite from that end.
	Roll up tightly.
	Light and enjoy!
