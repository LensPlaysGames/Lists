Mar. 28, '21 - CREATION!



STUFF I WANT TO DO:
	
ZVS DRIVER (Zero-Voltage Switching):
	[BY] KEYSTONE SCIENCE
	
	[ESTIMATED COST] $40
	
	[MATERIALS]
		- Flyback Transformer (used in CRT TVs, can be found online for ~$20).
		- 2 IRFP250N MOSFETs, heatsinked
		- 2 12V Zener Diodes
		- 2 2W 470 resistors
		- 2 10k resistors
		- 0.68uF High Voltage Capacitor
		- 40-200uH inductor
		- 2 FR107 ultra-fast diodes
		- 12-100v power supply
		
	[PROCEDURE] DETAILED HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsgRk5IO9UI
	
	[USES]
		- POWERFUL ELECTRICAL ARC, 'DISPLAY'
		- REMOTE IGNITION (Fireworks fuse)
		- INDUCTION HEATING (the same circuit can be used as an induction heater if used with a center-tapped thick-gauge copper wire coil.
