Mar. 28, '21 - CREATION!



STUFF TO DO:

HANDHELD HIGH-VOLTAGE:
	[BY] KEYSTONE SCIENCE
	
	[ESTIMATED COST] $10
	
	[MATERIALS]
		- 3-6v to 400kV Boost/Step-Up Converter (like $5 ea on eBay)
		- 9v Battery
		- Momentary Push-Button
		- Nails/Electrodes
		
	[PROCEDURE] DETAILED HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr2XvB95rV8
		Boost Converter has two input wires, positive and negative, as well as two high-voltage output wires.
		Wire each of the two nails, or electrodes of choice, to each the high voltage wires.
		Secure them anywhere from 5mm to 25mm, depending on arc length achievable (~1cm works most of the time). 
		Make sure the high-voltage electrodes are closest where you want them to arc.
		Wire one of the Boost Converter input wires to one side of the momentary push-button, and the other side of the push-button to the battery, making sure the polarity is that of the wire that goes to the other side of the button.
		Wire the other input wire to the opposite polarity on the battery, and there you have it!
		A push-button (possible lethal) taser.
		Be careful, and have fun arcing!
		
	

ZVS DRIVER (Zero-Voltage Switching):
	[BY] KEYSTONE SCIENCE
	
	[ESTIMATED COST] $40
	
	[MATERIALS]
		- Flyback Transformer (used in CRT TVs, can be found online for ~$20).
		- 2 IRFP250N MOSFETs, heatsinked
		- 2 12V Zener Diodes
		- 2 2W 470 resistors
		- 2 10k resistors
		- 0.68uF High Voltage Capacitor
		- 40-200uH inductor
		- 2 FR107 ultra-fast diodes
		- 12-100v power supply
		
	[PROCEDURE] DETAILED HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsgRk5IO9UI
	
	[USES]
		- POWERFUL ELECTRICAL ARC, 'DISPLAY'
		- REMOTE IGNITION (Fireworks fuse)
		- INDUCTION HEATING (the same circuit can be used as an induction heater if used with a center-tapped thick-gauge copper wire coil.
